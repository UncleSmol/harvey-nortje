            <h2>About Notarial Services</h2>
            <p>
              Notarial services involve the preparation and execution of specialized legal documents that 
              require the involvement of a Notary Public. A Notary Public is an attorney who has passed 
              additional examinations and is authorized to perform specific legal functions, including the 
              authentication and certification of documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Harvey Nortje Attorneys, our notaries provide expert services for a range of notarial 
              matters, ensuring that all documents are legally sound and properly executed according to 
              South African law.
